5</span>PROUD SIGNILD.</h2>
<p>Proud Signild&rsquo;s bold brothers have taken her hand,<br />
They&rsquo;ve wedded her into a far distant land.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve wedded her far from her own native land,<br />
To her father&rsquo;s foul murderer gave they her hand.</p>
<p>And so for eight winters the matter it stood,<br />
Their face for eight winters she never once view&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Proud Signild she brews, and the ruddy wine blends;<br />
To her brothers so courteous a bidding she sends.</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>Sir Loumor then laughed to his heart&rsquo;s very
core&mdash;<br />
Not once had he laughed for eight winters before.</p>
<p>To the top of the castle proud Signild she goes,<br />
And thence she so many a wistful look throws.</p>
<p>And now she perceives down the green hillock&rsquo;s side<br
/>
Her seven bold brothers so furiously ride.</p>
<p>Proud Signild she stands on the castle&rsquo;s high peak,<br
/>
She hears in the courtyard her seven brothers speak.</p>
<p>Proud Signild she hastes her array to put on,<br />
And unto the hall to Sir Loumor she&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now hear thou, Sir Loumor, thou lord, great and
fine,<br />
&ldquo;Wilt welcome these seven bold brothers of mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll welcome these seven bold brothers of
thine,<br />
Proud Signild, as if they were brothers of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Loumor again a wild laughter outsent,<br />
And the hard marble wall by that laughter was rent.</p>
<p>Then outspake the child in the cradle that lay,<br />
No word had the child ever spoke till that day:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shows that no good is about to take place,<br />
When my father he laughs in my dear mother&rsquo;s
face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With his foot he the cradle has spurned with such force<br />
That out rolled the baby, a blood-besprent corse.</p>
<p>So matters passed on &rsquo;till of evening the fall,<br />
To the evening repast the relations went all.</p>
<p>Sir Loumor her lord she placed at the board&rsquo;s head,<br
/>
To the stools at the bottom her brothers she led.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>To Sir Loumor she handed the stout ruddy wine,<br />
To her brothers she only sweet milk will assign.</p>
<p>Sir Loumor pretended to drink deep and fast,<br />
But in secret the wine down beneath him he cast.</p>
<p>Proud Signild now to the bed chamber wends,<br />
And the bed she prepares for her dear-beloved friends.</p>
<p>The bed she outspreads on the hard rugged stone,<br />
And that to prevent them from sleeping was done.</p>
<p>And under their sides she placed slily their knives,<br />
Which well they might trust in defence of their lives.</p>
<p>She also has placed underneath their bed heads<br />
Their actons of steel, and their keen naked blades.</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>&rsquo;Twas late, late at night, and the lights were
burnt low,<br />
And away to their couches it lists them to go.</p>
<p>No sooner proud Signild had sunk to repose,<br />
Than from her white side dread Sir Loumor arose.</p>
<p>To the hall, the dark hall, took Sir Loumor his way,<br />
Proud Signild&rsquo;s seven brothers intending to slay.</p>
<p>To the side of the bed upon tip toe he drew,<br />
And the seven bold brothers he traitorously slew.</p>
<p>In his fell hand uptakes he both faulchion and knife,<br />
And each of the sleepers deprived he of life.</p>
<p>In a bowl he collects of the murdered the gore,<br />
And that he brings in the proud Signild before.</p>
<p>In, in at the door-way Sir Loumor he sped,<br />
From Signild&rsquo;s cheek faded the beautiful red.</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>&ldquo;Sir Loumor, my lord, thy looks fill me with
fright,<br />
Say where hast thou been in the midst of the night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to the hall, if the truth I must
tell,<br />
I heard my two hunting hawks screech there, and yell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O why of thy hawks art thou talking, my lord?<br />
May God in his mercy my dears brothers guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Loumor produced of her brothers the gore,<br />
And that by her foot he has placed on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now drink thou, proud Signild, my much beloved Dame,<br
/>
This blood from the veins of thy brothers that came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a terrible thirst I must needs be distrest,<br />
When I, O Sir Loumor, obey thy behest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to bed and to sleep, my dear lord, now repair,<br
/>
Full little, be sure for my brothers I care.</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>&ldquo;I care not although all my kindred are slain,<br
/>
Since thee, my heart&rsquo;s dearest, alive I retain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So things in this fashion for eight winters stood,<br />
And Sir Loumor his brothers and sisters ne&rsquo;er
view&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Sir Loumor he brews, and the ruddy wine blends,<br />
To his brothers and sisters a bidding he sends.</p>
<p>Then laughed the proud Signild, that dame fair of face,<br />
And the first time it was for full eight winters space.</p>
<p>Sir Loumor&rsquo;s relations she placed at the board,<br />
And she handed them mead with so many a fair word.</p>
<p>Of the wine, the clear wine, drank Sir Loumor so free,<br />
For his life not the slightest precaution took he.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>On the soft down she spread their beds high from the
ground,<br />
She wished to procure for them slumbers so sound.</p>
<p>She spread out their beds on the bolsters of blue,<br />
Thereon with her fingers the sleep runes she drew.</p>
<p>No sooner Sir Loumor had sunk to repose,<br />
Than from his embrace the proud Signild arose.</p>
<p>From out of a corner she took a keen sword,<br />
She&rsquo;ll awake with its point the dear kin of her lord.</p>
<p>To the sleeping apartment proud Signild then sped,<br />
And straightway his five belov&rsquo;d brothers slew dead.</p>
<p>Though her heart it was sad, and the tears in her eyes,<br />
His three belov&rsquo;d sisters she slew in like guise.</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>Then swift in a bowl she collects the red gore,<br />
And that she brought in good Sir Loumor before.</p>
<p>She took off the chaplet her brow from around,<br />
And firmly the hands of Sir Loumor she bound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now wake thou, Sir Loumor, and speak to thy wife,<br />
I&rsquo;ll not, whilst thou sleepest, deprive thee of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now drink, O Sir Loumor, the kind and the good,<br />
Drink, drink thy dear brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo;
heart&rsquo;s blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O sore would the thirst be, O Signild, full sore,<br />
That ever could tempt me to drink of that gore.</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>&ldquo;Thyself to thy bed, my sweet Signild, betake,<br
/>
For the death of my kindred my heart will not break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Loumor sought after his trusty brown brand,<br />
And found to his fear he was bound foot and hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Signild, proud Signild, I pray thee now spare,<br />
And aye to be kind to thee, Signild, I swear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Methinks that thou didst little kindness display,<br />
The time thou my father didst murderously slay!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou slewest my father with treacherous glaive,<br />
And then my dear brothers, so beauteous and brave.</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>&ldquo;Then hope not for mercy, on vengeance I&rsquo;m
bent,<br />
Because all I cherished from me thou hast rent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she drew forth the knife from her sleeve bloody red,<br
/>
And Sir Loumor she stabbed till the life from him fled.</p>
<p>Then out from its cradle the little child spake:<br />
&ldquo;That deed, if I live, I will some day ywrake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that thou art of the very same blood,<br />
And I never expect thou to me wilt be good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child by the small of the leg she has ta&rsquo;en,<br />
And against the bed side she has beat out its brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I, the proud Signild, have slain man for man,<br />
And I&rsquo;ll hie me away to my land and my clan.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD</h2>
<p>The Knight takes hawk, and the man takes hound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And away to the good green-wood they rambled;<br />
There beasts both great and small they found,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Amid the forest glades that gambol&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>A hind &rsquo;neath a linden tree he spied,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A maid beneath the willows sitting;<br />
The Knight outspread his mantle wide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within that spot for love so fitting.</p>
<p>And there throughout the night they lie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And no one sought their rest to trouble;<br />
The linden tree so charmingly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Conceals them with its foliage noble.</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>No sooner dawned the morning light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And early cocks commenced their crowing,<br />
The Damsel pats on his breast the knight:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sweet love, you must be up and going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ride o&rsquo;er the brig at full career,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And o&rsquo;er the verdant meadows hurry;<br />
My brothers seven you&rsquo;ll meet I fear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So full of courage, strength, and fury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If seven or ten thy brothers be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each full of courage, strength, and beauty,<br />
If a comrade good they seek in me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I trust I know a comrade&rsquo;s duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if me they&rsquo;ll have as a brother dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their brother straight to be I&rsquo;m willing;<br
/>
But they shall win the victory ne&rsquo;er<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If bent my youthful blood on spilling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O dearest heart, with tears I pray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That thou wilt not go lightly nigh them,<br />
But ride about another way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Far distant off thou may&rsquo;st descry
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>&ldquo;O ne&rsquo;er at court shall it be said<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That I, a knight, for warriors seven,<br />
Or ten times seven, the straight road fled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To match them all I trust in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His sword to his side the warrior tied,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then himself in his acton casing,<br />
A fond adieu to the Damsel cried,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who sadly stood behind him gazing.</p>
<p>The youth despising all alarms<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With spur so keen his courser urges,<br />
Seven knights he meets in burnished arms<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From out the wood as he emerges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, early met, thou warrior good,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pray tell us what thou hast been doing!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;O I have been to the good green-wood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With hound and hawk the deer pursuing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is thy hawk and greyhound, say?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy silvan spoil, we pray thee show it.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;A good friend came across my way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And on that friend I did bestow it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>&ldquo;No knight will part with his prey so light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For which in wood he&rsquo;s toiled and panted;<br
/>
With a maiden bright you slept last night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her brothers&rsquo; leave nor sought nor
granted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To chase the dun deer, Sirs, I rode,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full little of your sister knowing,<br />
The first fair deer itself that showed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I chased with heart and bosom glowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It crouched beneath my scarlet cloak,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It pleased me, Sirs, beyond all measure;<br />
With thanks to heaven the gift I took,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And made me happy with my treasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I let my hounds the wild deer chase,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought but little of their capture;<br />
But I took the hind to my embrace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What moments then of bliss and rapture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the world&rsquo;s fair maids was she<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fairest both in face and carriage;<br />
If she, Sir Knights, your sister be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I beg your sister&rsquo;s hand in marriage.</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>&ldquo;A faithful brother I will be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in your cause I death will suffer;<br />
And her I&rsquo;ll hold in respect and love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And nothing more a knight can proffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt not get the maid for mate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But thou shalt die, thou knight enamour&rsquo;d;<br
/>
So make thy shrift &rsquo;neath the linden straight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The little birds shall hear it stammer&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now wilt thou stand, or wilt thou fly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into the deep wood for protection;<br />
Or guard thy young life valiantly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To prove thy courage and affection?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O I will stand, nor craven fly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unto the murky wood for cover,<br />
I&rsquo;ll guard my life right valiantly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thus I&rsquo;ll prove me worthy of
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First one he slew, then quickly two,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His knightly courage well display&rsquo;d he;<br />
But, though his seven foes he slew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With his own life full dearly paid he.</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>When the tidings reached the maiden&rsquo;s ear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She let fall briny tears in plenty;<br />
But if for her kin she shed one tear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She shed I ween for the bold knight twenty.</p>
<h2><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>DAMSEL METTIE.</h2>
<p>Knights Peter and Olaf they sat o&rsquo;er the board,<br />
Betwixt them in jesting passed many a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now hear thou, Sir Olaf my comrade, do tell<br />
Why thou hast ne&rsquo;er wedded some fair demoiselle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What need with a housewife myself to distress,<br />
So long as my little gold horn I possess?</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long as my little gold horn I possess,<br />
I lure every maid I may wish to caress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Damsel is not in the world to be found,<br />
But what I can lure with that little horn&rsquo;s
sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know a proud damsel that dwells by the rill,<br />
On her thou couldst never accomplish thy will.</p>
<p><!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll gage my war courser, the steady and
tried,<br />
Thou never canst lure the fair Mettie, my bride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Against him I&rsquo;ll gage my grey courser of
power,<br />
That she shall this evening repair to my bower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My courser so proud, and my neck bone so white<br />
I&rsquo;ll gage that I lure the fair Mettie this
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas late in the evening, mist fell from the skies,<br
/>
Sir Olaf he plays in his very best guise.</p>
<p>Sir Olaf he plays on his gold harp a strain,<br />
That heard the proud Mettie far over the plain.</p>
<p>Sir Olaf a tune on his golden horn blew,<br />
To the house of fair Mettie the thrilling sounds flew.</p>
<p>Long stood the fair Mettie and listened thereto:<br />
&ldquo;Now shall I or not to that horn-player go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long stood damsel Mettie in doubt and in care:<br />
&ldquo;No one of my maidens take with me I dare.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>The maid and the little brown messan her friend,<br />
Through the paths of the forest so lonely they wend.</p>
<p>Her mantle of blue the fair Mettie puts on,<br />
And unto the bower of Sir Olaf she&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>On the door of the chamber she gave a low knock:<br />
&ldquo;Sir Olaf, I pray thee, arise and unlock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O none have I summoned to me at this hour,<br />
And unto no one will I open my door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Olaf, arise, let me in I request,<br />
At what I have heard I&rsquo;m so sorely distrest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At what thou hast heard, be thou glad or distrest,<br
/>
Thou comest not into my bower of rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But soon should the door to thee open I wot,<br />
Provided Sir Peter thy sweetheart were not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although in my heart I may love thee full dear,<br />
Sir Peter for me to admit thee&rsquo;s too near.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>&ldquo;Sir Olaf, arise, let me in I implore,<br />
The night-dew falls chilly my scarlet dress
o&rsquo;er.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though chill fall the night-dew thy scarlet dress
o&rsquo;er,<br />
I dare not, O Mettie, fling open my door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since into thy bower thou lett&rsquo;st me not come,<br
/>
O let thy swains guide me, dear heart, to my home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The night it is bright, and the moon sheds her ray,<br
/>
Fair maid, thou wilt find without trouble thy way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moon&rsquo;s in the sky, and shines clear
o&rsquo;er the mead,<br />
So back by thyself to thy chamber proceed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid, and the little brown messan her friend,<br />
They home through the forest so lonely must wend.</p>
<p><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>And when to the gate of the castle she came,<br />
Sir Peter was leaning against it his frame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thrice welcome, thrice welcome, thou proud Mettelil,<br
/>
Say where hast thou been in the night season still?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I walked out, my lord, by no mortal eye seen,<br />
And I gathered the herbs both the blue and the green.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The herbs I collected with diligent hand,<br />
Which just at this season in fullest bloom stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stood in the meadows throughout the long night,<br />
And harked to the nightingale&rsquo;s song with
delight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! not to the song from the nightingale&rsquo;s
throat,<br />
But unto Sir Olaf his gilded horn&rsquo;s note.</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>&ldquo;This night&rsquo;s walk, and others of similar
sort,<br />
Will make thee the subject of common report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The walk of this night, and perhaps many more,<br />
By the Saints, my fair Mettie, this walking give o&rsquo;er.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now hear thou proud Mettie, to bed hie away,<br />
And &rsquo;neath the white linen thy fair body lay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depart to thy bed, that I rede thee to do,<br />
Would&rsquo;st have me remain to thee tender and true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost now my courser, the steady and
tried,<br />
Because thou hast proved thee a false, fickle bride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And what became of her no man ever knew,<br />
Nor whither her ashes before the wind flew.</p>
<p><!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>But as soon as her bower in ruddy flame blazed<br />
In the breast of Sir Peter such anguish was raised.</p>
<p>Sir Peter he grieved to his very death day,<br />
Sir Olaf ne&rsquo;er ventured to cross his friend&rsquo;s
way.</p>
<p>I counsel each swain, in affectionate part,<br />
To tempt not too hardly the maid of his heart.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
